There were three pigs ready to move out from their mom and dads house.
Each of the three pigs were ready to build their own house. 
The youngest pig decided to build his house out of straw.
The middle pig decided to build his house ot of wood.
The oldest pig decided to build hus house out of brick.
One day there was a wolf who was super hungry. 
He saw the three house all near eachother. 
The wolf went to the youngest pigs house and blew super hard wth his mouth and the whole house tore down. There was straw everywhere. 
After seing the house destroyed the pig ran over to the middle pigs house. 
Then the wolf went over to the middle pigs house and decided to blow on the wood house. The wollf blew really hard again that even the wood house torw aprt. 
Then both of the pigs ran over to the oldest pigs house which was made out of brick. 
When the wolf went over to try to blow the house down there was a problem. Since the house was made out of brick the wolf couldnt blow the house down. 
Once the pigs knew they were safe the started mocking the wolf.
Once the wolf saw the three pigs mocking itself he deiced to climb on the roof of the brick house. 
Once on the roof the wolf decied he could get in by cimbing down the chimney the two younger pigs saw and were scared. 
But the older pig told them not to wory and turned the chimney on and the wolf burned and died. 
After that the pigs lived happily ever after.
